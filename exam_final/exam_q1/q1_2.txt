1. The type of answer is `&str`.

2. Rust has a property which allows blocks to be used as expressions, called
'Block Expressions'.

3. 'Block expressions'. It is a '{' followed by inner attributes, then statements,
then an optional expression (final operand) and then a '}'. Basically, a block
will execute each statement and then execute the expression, if given. If it doesn't
end in an expression, its value is ().
Each block introduces a new namespace scope. So essentially, blocks are always value
expressions and evaluate the last expression.
